Instructions and scripts to help you compile and run custom code on certain Verifone devices.

## Supported devices

This means that your device may not be vulnerable if it has a new enough bootloader version.
Additionally, payloads have to be customized for each combination of {model, SBI version, OS version}. The following are provided at the moment:

- VX820: (TODO)
- e355: (TODO)
